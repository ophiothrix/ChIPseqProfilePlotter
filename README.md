# ChIPseqProfilePlotter
A wrapper script to plot a coverage profile from one or more bam files for a given genomic region or gene

Additional functionality to extract and plot averaged coverage over multiple genomic regions, e.g. TSS.

Refer to ./src/use.cases.R for typical usage.

### Use case 1 ###
Plot coverage over specific genomic region
![Use Case 1](graphs/use.case.1.png?raw=true "Use Case 1")

### Use case 2 ###
Plot coverage over specific gene
![Use Case 2](graphs/use.case.2.png?raw=true "Use Case 2")

### Use case 3 ###
Plot averaged coverage over all TSS on chromosome 19
![Use Case 3](graphs/use.case.3.png?raw=true "Use Case 3")
